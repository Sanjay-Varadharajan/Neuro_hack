Innovation
1️⃣ Extra Security Layer

Normally:

Gmail filters spam automatically.

User never sees how it decides.

Your system:

Adds a second AI check.

Independently scans emails.

Shows the result clearly.

So it’s like a second security guard watching the inbox.

2️⃣ Full Transparency

Gmail just says “Spam”.

Your system shows:

Fraud or Safe

Confidence percentage

Stored history

Dashboard analytics

Users can actually see what’s happening.

3️⃣ Automated Monitoring

No manual checking.
No button clicking.

It:

Scans inbox automatically

Classifies emails

Stores results

Updates dashboard

That automation + AI combo is your strength.

4️⃣ Lightweight & Customizable

Big companies use heavy, expensive systems.
